## Docker Images

The custom base images used by Warden environments can be found on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/davidalger/warden) or on Github: https://github.com/davidalger/docker-images-warden

In addition to these custom base images, Warden also utilizes official images such as `redis`, `rabbitmq` and `mailhog` for example.
