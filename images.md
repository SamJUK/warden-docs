## Docker Images

The custom base images used by Warden environments can be found on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/davidalger/warden). Source files are in the `images` directory of the main project repository.

In addition to these custom base images, Warden also utilizes official images such as `redis`, `rabbitmq` and `mailhog` which may be found on Docker Hub.
